# Register for API keys


Within this assignment I will be utilizing data from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics Public Data API and the Federal Reserve Board. In order to obtain the
data I require I will sign up for API keys from both of these organizations.

# Clean Data
Since we know that CPI and Unemployment are from the same site we cna cleanse them
the same and add them to the same data frame

```{r}
# Directly assigning a new name to the column
unemployment$`unemployment rate` <- unemployment$value
unemployment <- unemployment[-4] 
```


```{r}
cpi$`cpi rate` <- cpi$value
cpi <- cpi[-4] 
cpi <- cpi[, !(names(cpi) %in% c("period","footnotes"))]
```


```{r}
fred$year <- year(fred$date)
fred$periodName <- month.name[month(fred$date)]
fred$`federal funds rate` <- fred$value
fred <- fred[, !(names(fred) %in% c("realtime_start","value", "realtime_end", "date"))]

```


```{r}
df <- cpi
df$`unemployment rate` <- unemployment$`unemployment rate`
df <- merge(df, fred, by = c("year", "periodName"))
```

# Data Visualization
```{r}
# Create a new column "Month-Year" by combining "year" and "periodName"

library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your DataFrame is called df and the "MonthYear" column is of class 'yearmon'
# If you haven't already converted it, you can do it with:
# df$MonthYear <- as.yearmon(df$MonthYear, format = "%Y-%B")

# Create a line plot for CPI
plot_cpi <- ggplot(df, aes(x = MonthYear, y = `cpi rate`)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "CPI Over Time", y = "CPI Rate")

# Create a line plot for Unemployment Rate
plot_unemployment <- ggplot(df, aes(x = MonthYear, y = `unemployment rate`)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Unemployment Rate Over Time", y = "Unemployment Rate")

# Create a line plot for Federal Funds Rate

                          ncol = 1, align = "v")

```



# Conclusion
If you look at this illustration it suggests that If CPI remains steady or stable, 
then The Federal Reserve has been controlling inflation and has policy in place
to tackle the phenomenon. When we look at the Unemployment rate overtime, we want 
to see that it is also low suggesting that the Federal Reserve is also taking 
control of that5 scenario. Last the Funds Rate is the tool the Federal Reserve
utilizes to control these parameters so we want to see where this has direct 
correlation with unemployment and CPI. Overall The data shows that the Federal 
Reserve has been controlling the economy with policy besides in the years of JAN2020.
This is significant because this would be a black swan year where COVID-19 would
create a pandemic.This is overall alarming however because if we look at the funds
rate currently. It means that there is a serious wave of layoffs soon to come.
